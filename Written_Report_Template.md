# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
This project is to help Louise determine which countries and time .

## Analysis and Challenges
- Some of the challenge came when we attempted to analyze the data without converting the dates. 
- Once the date issue was fixed we were able to incorporate dates to determine if there is a better time of year to launch a kickstart. 
- We also wanted to see if there was any correlation between goal and the success of failure of the kickstart.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
