# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

This project was to help Louise determine the best location, time and type of kickstart to invest in. 

## Analysis and Challenges
- One of the first challenges we came across was how to clean up the data to it most usuable state. 
- This cleanup required changing date formate, splitting cells, reorgainzing columm, and moving data around.
- First we reviewed and sort the data (clean up) for analysis. Some of the challenges when sorting the date was wwrong data types and too uch data in the columns to sort deep enough. We identified wrong data types for the launch and ..... date so we used a date conversion function to format the date into a standard view. For the categories of kickstarts we separated parent and sub category so we are able to drill down deeper for our analysis.

- Once the date cleanup was complete we moved on to analizing the data. We utilized a variety of excel functions like count, vslookup, and sum to gather our numbers and calculate things like success rate, percetage successful, total pledge, and other key totals that can be usesd to identify our goals.

Through the use of pivot tables and pivot graphs we were able to tell the story to support our findings by using basic tables and graphs to visually represent our data.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
